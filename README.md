# Are you brand new to coding? Want to see how fun and easy it can be? Watch engaging experts Susan Ibach and
# Christopher Harrison for an entertaining introduction to programming with Python. Susan and Christopher offer
# a step-by-step walk-through, from a basic idea to translating that idea into code, and everything in between.
#
# Don't worry about making mistakes! Python uses simple syntax, has an easy learning curve, and is a very forgiving
# language. Gain a new skill or complete a task by the end of each module, and, by the end of the course, you will be
# programming in Python! You also learn basic principles which can make it easier for you to learn other programming
# languages in the future. Don't miss this opportunity to go beyond the if statement!

#
# Getting Started
# Explore applications of Python language, and create a "Hello world" application for Python in Visual Studio,
# as you learn the benefits of knowing Python. Get help setting up your computer, so you can start coding.
#
# Displaying Text
# Get an introduction to the print statement, comments, and basic formatting, so you can display and format text
# to a user.
#
# String Variables
# Learn about the input statement, string variables, and manipulate strings, so you can prompt a user for input,
# store values in a string, and use string functions to manipulate string values.
#
# Storing Numbers
# Hear an introduction to numeric datatypes and variables, how to do math operations, and datatype conversions.
# Learn to store numeric values and perform math operations.
#
# Working with Dates and Times
# Get the details on date variable storage and issues, along with date functions and formatting, so you can store
# and manipulate date values.
#
# Making Decisions with Code
# Hear an introduction to basic if/else statements and Boolean variables, so you can write code that reacts differently
# to different user inputs.
#
# Complex Decisions with Code
# Explore and/or statements, nested if statements, and elif, so you can write code that reacts differently to more
# complex user inputs.
#
# Repeating Events
# Take a look at for loops and nested for loops, so you can write programming in Python that repeats a fixed number
# of times.
#
# Repeating Events Until Done
# Play with while loops, and learn when to use for versus while loops, so you can write code that repeats as often
# as needed.
#
# Remembering Lists
# Get the details on arrays and lists, so you can store multiple values.
#
# How to Save Information in Files
# Hear about functions for creating and writing to files, so you can write code that saves information in a file and
# remember it later.
#
# Reading from Files
# Explore functions for reading from files, so you can read information that was saved in a file.
#
# Functions
# Learn about the syntax for declaring functions and how to call functions from your code, so you can use functions to
# avoid retyping the same code over and over.
#
# Handling Errors
# Get the details on syntax for error handling, so you can write code that can handle common error situations without
# crashing.
